If there are IPS files (`*.ips`) but no NES (`*.nes`) files, it means that I cannot publish NES ROM files directly, due to copyright reason.

An IPS file is a patch, which can be applied to the original ROM file, to generate the modified ROM file.

There are many free softwares that support IPS patching, such as "Lunar IPS" on Windows.
