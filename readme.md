_Yuu Yuu Hakusho - Bakutou Ankoku Bujutsu Kai_: **No Barcode, New Skills**



# Description

- Use buttons to select character. When needed, press SELECT to display character ID. Press the arrow keys to adjust the ID. Player can select the character corresponding to the ID by pressing A, or randomly select it by pressing START (random is not available in the judgment room). During selection, the buttons do not distinguish between 1P/2P joypads.

- Many new skills have been added on top of the complete original skills (the character skills obtained through barcode input in the original version may be incomplete). See character_list for detail. The new skills are not only available to players, but also to AI.

- Another key binding is added to ↓(hold)↑+A skill. The original ↓(hold)↑+A is still valid.

- Defensive skills can be cast after the opponent activates the skill (in the original version, it can only be cast when the opponent does not activate the skill).

- All characters can be selected in both story mode and battle mode, including the hidden character younger Toguro 120% (which did not appear in the original story mode). In battle mode, both sides can use the same fighter (without going to the judgment room).

- In story mode, player can choose a character before the battle against younger Toguro 80% (Yusuke Urameshi was always used in the original version).

- After defeating younger Toguro 80% in the story mode, if the remaining HP >= 2000, the final boss will be changed from younger Toguro 100% to younger Toguro 120% (which did not appear in the original story mode), and HP/SP of player's own fighter will increase by 1500 each.

- During the battle, both sides' SP automatically recovers 10 every second. When someone goes out of bounds, both sides will recover 100 SP each.

- When the battle pauses, player can press SELECT to change music. There are 6 pieces of music available.

- After being defeated in story mode, the game over screen will display yes/no, which can be understood as whether to save the progress. Select yes, then return to the title screen and enter the battle mode selection screen, there will be an additional "continue" option. Selecting "continue" will continue the progress of the previous story mode, starting from the first person of the opponent's team before.
